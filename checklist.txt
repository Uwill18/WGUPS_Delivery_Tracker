start with identifying comment
•   Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.
•   The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour and have an infinite amount of gas with no need to stop.
•   There are no collisions.
•   Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries. Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
•   Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed.
 •   The delivery and loading times are instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery or when moving packages to a truck at the hub (that time is factored into the calculation of the average speed of the trucks).
•   There is up to one special note associated with a package.
•   The delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect and will be updated at 10:20 a.m. However, WGUPS does not know the correct address (410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111) until 10:20 a.m.
•   The distances provided in the WGUPS Distance Table are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
•   The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.

Section B
The submission describes the IDE and the version of Python used in the application. A description of the hardware is not observed.


Section C
The submission includes original Python code that runs without error.  The submission is insufficient because each time option one is selected, it increments the truck mileage and it increases to over 140 miles.
The submission presents Python code. A solution that runs without errors or warnings is not observed. A program that runs successfully, including option 3 upon entering a time, is needed to meet standards.


section G
The submission delivers packages within 117.10 miles when option one is run the first time. The submission is insufficient because the results do not indicate the truck the packages are loaded on.
