start with identifying comment
•   Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.
•   The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour and have an infinite amount of gas with no need to stop.
•   There are no collisions.
•   Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries. Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
•   Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed.
 •   The delivery and loading times are instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery or when moving packages to a truck at the hub (that time is factored into the calculation of the average speed of the trucks).
•   There is up to one special note associated with a package.
•   The delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect and will be updated at 10:20 a.m. However, WGUPS does not know the correct address (410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111) until 10:20 a.m.
•   The distances provided in the WGUPS Distance Table are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
•   The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
