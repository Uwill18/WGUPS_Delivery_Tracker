"Because KNN is based on feature similarity, we can do classification using KNN classifier."
KNN is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that classifies a data point according to its similarity to its neighbors.
parameter tuning is used to improve accuracy. where k is drastically changes the answer.
choosing to high or low a "k-value" distorts the value.
sqrt k
if even make an odd k number by adding one or subtracting one from the root
be specific with the data needed
knn may struggle to extract the correct patterns
nearest neighbors can be found using the Euclidean distance formula:
d = √[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2]
