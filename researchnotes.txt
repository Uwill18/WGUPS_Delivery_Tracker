"Because KNN is based on feature similarity, we can do classification using KNN classifier."
KNN is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that classifies a data point according to its similarity to its neighbors.
parameter tuning is used to improve accuracy. where k is drastically changes the answer.
choosing to high or low a "k-value" distorts the value.
sqrt k
if even make an odd k number by adding one or subtracting one from the root
be specific with the data needed
knn may struggle to extract the correct patterns
nearest neighbors can be found using the Euclidean distance formula:
d = √[(x2 – x1)^2 + (y2 – y1)^2]

Test for Euclidean distance --(1)

14-15m example

euclidean formula can go in multiple dimensions to find the nearest neighbor
subtract one numpy array from another numpy array, is every val in p minus every val in q is the result
square the result, sum it, then sqrt it, finally return it

fit function is used for training the points
Color points(2)

fit functions train the datasets

predict function does the calculations
_predict function is a helper that obtains one data point

euclidean distance global function is used

# A.  Identify a named self-adjusting algorithm (e.g., “Nearest Neighbor algorithm,” “Greedy algorithm”) that you used to create your program to deliver the packages.
# Nearest Neighbor (sololearn)
#The K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm was elected in this program as the solution for this traveling salesman problem.
K-Nearest Neighbor uses the hyperparameter k to group sets of data points for classifications and predictions.

# B.  Write an overview of your program, in which you do the following:
#
# 1.  Explain the algorithm’s logic using pseudocode.
#
#
#
# Note: You may refer to the attached “Sample Core Algorithm Overview” to complete part B1.
#
#
#
# 2.  Describe the programming environment you used to create the Python application.
# Pycharm 2023.2,
# Python 3.10.7
pip 23.2.1 to install numpy 1.25.2 for knn implementation

no pandas, numpy or third-party libraries
can use csv library, reader or dictionary reader

# 3.  Evaluate the space-time complexity of each major segment of the program, and the entire program, using big-O notation.
#
# 4.  Explain the capability of your solution to scale and adapt to a growing number of packages.
#
# 5.  Discuss why the software is efficient and easy to maintain.
# Commenting, and modular programming by defining a class for  specific function set, and using the naming conventions for python

# 6.  Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the self-adjusting data structures (e.g., the hash table).

# D.  Identify a self-adjusting data structure, such as a hash table, that can be used with the algorithm identified in part A to store the package data.
#
# 1.  Explain how your data structure accounts for the relationship between the data points you are storing.
#
#
#
# Note: Use only appropriate built-in data structures, except dictionaries. You must design, write, implement, and debug all code that you turn in for this assessment.
# Code downloaded from the Internet or acquired from another student or any other source may not be submitted and will result in automatic failure of this assessment.


#
# I.  Justify the core algorithm you identified in part A and used in the solution by doing the following:
#
# 1.  Describe at least two strengths of the algorithm used in the solution.
#
# 2.  Verify that the algorithm used in the solution meets all requirements in the scenario.

# 3.  Identify two other named algorithms, different from the algorithm implemented in the solution, that would meet the requirements in the scenario.

How should I be thinking about inserting these packages in the hashmap?

What is missing with how I have instantiated these objects?

What does loading and unloading the truck look like in theory,
just storing an array, and popping off packages once a string location matches,
or once a distance matches?

With the trucks delivering packages, what is the best suggestion for time emulation?
I have hear if time delta, but I am unsure if that is best method and/or if it is
what this course is looking for.
