# WGUPS_Delivery_Tracker
Project to track deliveries for WGUPS

Program Purpose
This program uses Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to emulate effective package delivery for 40 packages while keeping truck mileage under 140 miles.
In this solution to C950's vehicle routing problem only two trucks were used and many delivery inconveniences were accounted for.
This program runs in O(n^2) time complexity

Program Use Instructions
To use this program you will be given three options:

1. TRACK PACKAGE -- Use package ID and time to track the status of one package at any time 
2. TRACK ALL PACKAGES -- Enter a time to track the status of all packages at any time 
3. PROGRAM EXIT -- Exit the Program
* Special Note : Both trucks have two routes each to meet all requirements for the program. *
