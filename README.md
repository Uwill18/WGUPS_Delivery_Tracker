Project to track deliveries for WGUPS

Program Purpose This program uses Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to emulate effective package delivery for all packages while keeping truck mileage under 140 miles. In this solution only two trucks were used and many delivery inconveniences were accounted for. This program runs in O(n^2) time complexity

Program Use Instructions To use this program you will first be given ten options:

CHECK FULL DELIVERY CYCLE -- See the total mileage and complete journey of all routes taken
TRACK PACKAGE -- Use package ID and time to track the status of one package at any time
TRACK ALL PACKAGES -- Enter a time to track the status of all packages at any time
CHECK ROUTE ONE OF FIRST TRUCK -- See the total mileage and journey of truck one of its first route
CHECK ROUTE ONE OF SECOND TRUCK -- See the total mileage and journey of truck two of its first route
CHECK ROUTE TWO OF FIRST TRUCK -- See the total mileage and journey of truck one of its second route
CHECK ROUTE TWO OF SECOND TRUCK -- See the total mileage and journey of truck two of its second route
VERIFY DELIVERY STATUS -- for any route, check the mileage of all trucks and the status of all packages
DEFINE ALL OPTIONS -- Descriptions as shown here illuminate the effect of user selections
PROGRAM EXIT -- Exit the Program
Special Note : Both trucks have two routes each to meet all requirements for the program. *
The intended use of this program is to use options 1 or 4 through 7 before selecting options 2 or 3 to check package statuses.
